# Human-computer-Interaction-SAGE-Vit-counselling-Application
In a massive campus like VIT, a lot of mental health cases go unnoticed and most of the students
are unaware of the existing consultation services provided by VIT. In order to counter these
issues, we are providing a counselling platform that users can utilise to keep their mental health
in check. Currently, there is no solid platform for students to book appointments or sessions with
counsellors or keep track of the ongoing sessions. They only resort to contacting these
counsellors via phone call. Moreover, students are not fully aware about how the procedure and
to what extent these services are effective which makes them skeptical and dubious to reach out.
This project aims towards understanding how the counselling system in VIT works and the
studentsâ€™ perspective.
This project works towards taking it through the five stages of a UX Design Thinking process by
conducting extensive research and gathering more information about user behaviour in this
scenario. Along with implementing innovative features in the app, a convenient, accessible and
equitable approach while interacting with the interface will be ensured.
